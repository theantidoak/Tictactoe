This project was completed for The Odin Project.

The purpose was to practice using alternatives to the object to object inheritance model by using module patterns, factory functions, closures, and scope to write cleaner, neater code in the javascript file. It was also a project to get a better understanding of 'this' value in various functions. With that, .call was used multiple times.

The game itself gives the user an option to play as 'X' or 'O' and choose whether to play against another human or play against a bot with two difficulty settings.

The 'easy' bot setting selects a random position to place its token. The 'hard' bot uses a minimax function to determine the best position.

The font style is called 'Waterway' taken from https://www.dafont.com/waterway.font and 'free for personal use'.
